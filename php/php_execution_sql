1. Design a PHP file with insert, update, edit and delete operations using MySQL database. 
Place all the files -home,insert_details,insert,display_details,update,edit in var/www directory



SQL Table :(For opening mysql ..goto terminal->mysql -u root -p
Enter password
create table student_details (register_number varchar(10), name varchar(10), branch varchar(3), batch varchar(10),address varchar(30),email varchar(20));
2.Place all these files in var/www folder
3.Change the password from random to ssn I think ..whatever database password is given in files insert.php,search.php,display_student_details.php
4.Go to browser ..and give localhost/home.php
You should see the home page with all options 

2.Google Book search for a keyword like say "Books in a Particular location" eg Books in amazon .. You should develop a PHP program to extract the google search results ..and display in alphabetical order of book names... 
Place the file webpage.php in var/www directory 
Go to browser ..and give localhost/webpage.php
Displays the elements in the <a> tag by constructing DOM tree from landmark.net web site :P
